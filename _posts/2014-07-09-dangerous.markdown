Thanks to [@cynthialanel](https://twitter.com/cynthialanel/status/486986287505604608) for this gem.

I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/britneywright/status/484905258909704192) last week about the importance of watching videos or reading blog posts in their entirety before going off to work on your own projects. I'm guilty of not doing this often and suffer the consequences. I spend hours looking to solve something, only to realize if I would've just watched two more minutes of a video or read a couple more paragraphs and that original resource would've solved what I was working on.
