<p>And in case you were wondering where the inspiration for the blog name came from. I have the #CodeNewbies Twitter chat to thank for that. In a moment of genius I tweeted the following:
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A4: To prepare for our tech future, I need to ABL: always be learning! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CodeNewbie?src=hash">#CodeNewbie</a>&lt;/p&gt;â€” Britney Wright (@britneywright) <a href="https://twitter.com/britneywright/statuses/481974760034013184">June 26, 2014</a>&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And a name and new blog idea were born.</p>
