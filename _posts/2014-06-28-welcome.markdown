And in case you were wondering where the inspiration for the blog name came from. I have the #CodeNewbies Twitter chat to thank for that. In a moment of genius I tweeted the following:

![A4: To prepare for our tech future, I need to ABL: always be learning! #CodeNewbie]({{ site.url }}/assets/2014/06/abl-tweet.jpg)

And a name and new blog idea were born.
