  <article class="post-content">
  <p>The best way I’ve found to retain knowledge and truly learn is by repeating myself. I engrain practices in my head through repition and see parts in a new light each time. More often than not I don’t revisit projects or exercises though and want to make a better habit of that. </p>

<p>Recently I spent some time with the always helpful, Josh Cheek. Josh was in D.C. for a week and spent a couple of days helping me to learn and learn how to learn. You read that right. From time to time I go through materials on <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>, which is a great, open-source (i.e. free as in beer), programming curriculum. It’s outlined similarly to many of the coding bootcamps that are growing in popularity and I definitely recommend checking it out. When Josh arrived I was just preparing to start a Ruby <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/advanced-building-blocks">exercise</a> that required me to write my own version of many of the common Enumerable methods. A bit of panic set in but Josh thought this was a great lesson and a great opportunity to try katas. A kata, in <a href="'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)'">programming terms</a>, is improving your skills and knowledge through pracitice and repition. So in this case I would write all of my Enumerable mehods and then write them again and again, hopefully getting faster each time and understanding them better which will also lead to refactoring. Actually writing my <a href="https://github.com/britneywright/my_enumerable">initial</a> Enumerable methods took hours. Thankfully Josh is a very patient teach and by the end I felt like I really gained a much deeper understanding of enumerables. You can see my first completed kata here. Afterwards, I rewrote all of my methods one or two more times before moving on to adding more methods. I got stuck here and there, but fortunately I was able to talk them out with Josh and push on. Unfortunately I let other shiny objects distract me and I haven’t revisited <a href="https://github.com/britneywright/my_enumerable_2">this exercise</a> in a couple of weeks. But yesterday something prompted me to remember it and the value it provided.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago I, along with my pair partner, started <a href="http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/">Rails Girls Summer of Code</a>. We’ll be working on two popular open source Ruby on Rails projects, BrowserCMS and Spree. BrowserCMS is a a content management system, for those unfamiliar with the CMS space, think Wordpress or Drupal, which are more commonly known, PHP-based, CMS platforms. Spree is an e-commerce platform. Our goal is to create a module for BrowserCMS that would make it easier to integrate Spree. We believe that this type of module would make it easier for developers to get started with them in a single project and could lead to increased use of both. So far we’ve focused on learning BrowserCMS by trying to build the basic features of an online store through the CMS (minus payment stuff). We had some hiccups at the start. Since BrowserCMS recently released a beta of their newest version a lot of the documentation is outdated so we’ve had to determine what instructions apply to us and what doesn’t as we’re building our sites. Over the past week I’ve been knocking items off our list of features we outlined as common to online bookstores. When we met yesterday though I realized that a lot of the approaches I took were not necessarily using BrowserCMS in the best way or weren’t the most efficient. For a moment I felt defeated, but then I thought back to the katas I did with the Enumerable methods. I realized that rather than just taking notes and moving on, this would be a great opportunity for me to go back through the features I’ve bult so far and do them again based on the discussions we had as a team. So that’s where I’m at now. About to start building version 2.0 of my pratice book store. My goal is to write my code more confidently this time, which to me means better and faster.</p>

<p>And once I finish rebuilding my project to it’s most current feature-set I think I’ll revisit my enumerable methods and do a few more katas with them.</p>

<p>Have you tried katas, The Odin Project or any of the other projects and ideas I mentioned? Let me know. As always you can find me on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/britneywright">@britneywright</a> and here on my blog <a href="http://alwaysbelearning.co">Always Be Learning</a>.</p>
