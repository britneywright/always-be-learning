This past weekend I attended <a href="http://www.steelcityruby.org/">Steel City Ruby Conf</a> in Pittsburgh, PA. It was my first programming conference outside of the DC area so I was a bit nervous, but also excited to visit another community. And the benefits of community ended up being the biggest takeaway I got from the conference. Unlike other conferences I’ve been to, SCRC wasn’t filled with all technical talks. Sure there were a few, but there were also a lot of talks that, in my opinion, were related to our relationship with programming. Each speaker brought their own set of experiences and background to the group which not only provided fresh perspective, but also helped me fuel an internal dialogue about what matters most to me. I won’t do a recap of all of the talks, but I will touch on the ones that I found the most compelling personally.</p>

<h3 id="remembering-scrc14">Remembering SCRC14</h3>

<p>Jean Lange, one of the organizers of SCRC and the MC for the event, opened the conference with a retrospective about the conference. It was highly atypical of a conference opening and really planted a seed for how I took in everything I experienced over the weekend. Jean talked about setting long and short term goals and asked us to think about what we could do over the course of the weekend to work towards those goals. She provided her own example of looking forward and looking back by stating the goal she made a year ago for SCRC14 and what she did over that year so that by the time the conference started her goal was realized. I didn’t write down her goal and I don’t want to misstate it, so I’ll just say it was about having a diverse and open conference. And to achieve that she set goals over the course of the year including creating a code of conduct, providing clear information, promoting the call for proposals, etc. I think it all goes back to one of my favorite habits of Stephen R. Covey, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Seven-Habits-Highly-Effective-People/dp/406204983X/ref=la_B000AQ2VAQ_1_21?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1408452003&amp;sr=1-21">The 7 Habits for Highly Affective People</a>. Covey’s second habit is Begin with the End in Mind. When we do this we are better able to comprehend how what we’re doing in the present and near future will effect our more distant future. This also helps us adjust course when we realize that what we’re doing isn’t on the path to our intended destination. </p>

<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about what I want out of work and although I still haven’t narrowed it down specifically I do know that I want to work in a team. Not just any team, a great team of people who are proud of their work. I’ve been plagued by this constant inability to find a job that places a strong importance on team. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve worked with some great people. And I’ve been proud of my work. But I’ve never felt like I was really part of a team, just one of a bunch of people who happen to be in close proximity and working for the same company. I decided I’d spend the conference connecting with people and talking with them about what they do, where they work, what the environment is like. It was really insightful and has motivated me to pursue that line of questioning more often so I can get a better sense of the variety of places that are out there and what’s most in line with my wants and needs.</p>

<h3 id="saving-the-world-with-ruby">Saving the World with Ruby</h3>

<p>I actually already heard this talk by <a href="http://twitter.com/seanmarcia">Sean Marcia</a> at Arlington Ruby a few months back, as he was preparing to give it at Rails Conf in Chicago. He talked about how he used Ruby, Sinatra and Raspberry Pis to help study bees at George Mason. Sean is such a great storyteller and he brought honey this time! Beyond the programming aspect he did a great job of showing how we as programmers should seek out opportunities to do work for a greater good than our day jobs typically allow and how we can get support from our employers in those efforts.  </p>

<h3 id="using-ruby-for-journalism">Using Ruby for Journalism</h3>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/derekwillis">Derek Willis</a>, of the New York Times, shared how programming has come to be a crucial part of news organizations for research, reporting and randomness. By randomness I mean the experimental projects Derek’s colleagues have created like <a href="http://haiku.nytimes.com/">Times Haiku</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/09/13/fashion-week-editors-picks/">Front Row to Fashion Week</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/02/23/movies/20080223_REVENUE_GRAPHIC.html?_r=0">The Ebb and Flow of Movies: Box Office Receipts 1986-2008</a>. Beyond the fact that it made me realize what brilliant minds work at the Times, it also illustrated how fostering a creative, collaborative work environment can produce innovative work. If a newsroom under constantly tight deadlines and battling old school ways of thinking can produce stimulating work then I think I owe it to myself to find a an environment that fosters that as well.  </p>

<h3 id="the-metaphysics-of-strings">The Metaphysics of Strings</h3>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/gregates">Greg Gates</a> is a teacher, philosopher and programmer and so it’s no surprise that his talk took on a much deeper meaning than simply comparing two strings. Greg broke down how we can look for and understand the underlying layers in a line of code. He also described how after determining why two lines of code looked the same but were different he wasn’t sure if they should be different or not. And it’s at this level that you know you are truly reading and understanding code at a deep level. This is important to me especially when I’m stuck on something and ask for help from others. Often times a more experienced programmer will brush off those rare programming anomalies by either saying, “don’t worry about that”, or “do this instead.” It’s not for me to say whether they understand what’s going on or not, but Greg made me realize there’s really value in taking the time to dig deeper and understand rather than making assumptions or dismissing something all together.</p>

<h3 id="dealing-with-the-demands-of-the-open-source-community">Dealing with the Demands of the Open Source Community</h3>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sethvargo">Seth Vargo</a>’s talk felt like a therapy session, at least ones I’ve seen on TV since I haven’t gone to therapy yet. He started by identifying the emotions we feel when our open source work is criticized. Then he dove deeper into the root of those feelings and finally what we can do to create a better dynamic with those who consume our projects. I liked the fact that at the end Seth brought his talk full circle and said that while it’s understandable to feel the way we do we still need to keep in mind the person on the other end consuming our product and how we can make them feel if we are critical back, particularly in a much larger open forum like social media. </p>

<h3 id="lightning-talks">Lightning Talks</h3>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%; display: block;" src="http://bukk.it/mindblown.gif" alt="mind blown" />
The lightning talks were all great and so different from one another. The first was How to Find GIFs by <a href="http://twitter.com/nqrush">Nick Quaranto</a>. He flew through his talk with storm force speed and energy. First he talked about sites where you can find GIFs, obvious ones like Buzzfeed (don’t use Buzzfeed) and some not so obvious ones like Reddit. Then he showed us the <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/141781-save-hot-posts-in-r-gifs-to-gifs-folder-in-dropbox">IFTTT recipe</a> he uses to automatically save GIFs into a Dropbox folder, which has over 6GB of GIFs!. And finally he showed us how to make our own GIFs by using our web cam and <a href="http://gifbrewery.com/">GIF Brewery</a>, a GIF converter. I’ve stayed away from using GIFs for one reason or another, but his enthusiasm and information have made me reconsider. </p>

<p>On a more serious level, the lightning talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/laurenvoswinkel">Lauren Voswinkel</a> about openly discussing your pay has caused me to do a lot of deeper reflecting. I don’t go around shouting my salary from the hilltops, but if anyone has ever asked how much I’m making I’m always willing to share it. I rarely ask others though because there does seem to be a general stigma about it. Either employers discourage it, or maybe people are afraid that they’ll start talking and discover big pay differences that could lead to resentment, power shifts, etc. I, like Lauren, believe that knowledge is power though. I didn’t talk to people about salaries before I interviewed for my current job, and as a result I think I’m making a lot less than I could be. That’s definitely a mistake I won’t make in the future. I’ll also encourage others to be open about it as well since our roles as developers are in such demand, there’s no reason that we shouldn’t be compensated adequately. But as a new programmer eager to work it can be easy to get taken advantage of, particularly in the age of startups and bootstrapping. I also learned a couple of things I hadn’t realized before. You are not required to tell potential employers what you made at your previous job if they ask. Also there are no laws that explicitly bar employees from discussing pay with one another and there are laws that prevent employers from retaliating against employees that do. There are nuances to these laws including the definition of an employee, so it’s best to do a little reading up if you aren’t sure. Lauren shared a recent <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/07/when-the-boss-says-dont-tell-your-coworkers-how-much-you-get-paid/374467/2/#comments">article</a> on her Twitter account by the The Atlantic that seems like a good intro to the topic. </p>

<h3 id="better-visualizations-with-science">Better Visualizations with Science</h3>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%; display: block;" src="/../assets/2014/08/apple_pie_chart.jpg" alt="mind blown" />
The part that most stuck with me of <a href="https://twitter.com/jxxf">John Feminella</a>’s talk was the anti-patterns he pointed out in data visualizations. Things people do that make data unclear or deceptive and should be avoided (unless you’re just a deceptive SOB I suppose). Things like tilting pie charts, adding volume to them and color choice can make smaller variables appear larger than variables that are actually larger. It was a good reminder as a consumer of information to really make sure I’m looking at what’s being presented and also what’s not being presented. Data visualizations are really what someone has extracted out as important to them. It’s up to us to go from there to find out more. </p>

<h3 id="from-dev-to-founder">From Dev to Founder</h3>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/brynary">Bryan Helmkamp</a> from Code Climate presented a very clear path to starting a company and did so in an informative and humorous way. I’m sure everyone’s heard a million tips and talks about starting a company so I’ll quickly summarize a few of the points still lingering in my mind from the talk. Bryan recommends starting a business-to-business company that produces recurring revenue of $67 on average per customer. B2B isn’t as complicated as B2B2C or as hard to generate sizable revenue as B2C. Starting off with a revenue model helps to keep you motivated to keep working on the business. And if you can get your first 150 customers paying $67 a month each on average you’ll earn $10,000 a month which can be enough to provide you the equivalent of a full-time salary. So really it’s just a matter of finding the idea that can fall in line with all of those things and the money should roll in, right? Probably not that simple, but definitely a good reminder of the KISS method. </p>

<h3 id="my-lightning-talk">My Lightning Talk</h3>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%" src="/../assets/2014/08/rails_girls_talk.jpg" alt="Rails Girls Lightning Talk" />
I, along with my Rails Girls Summer of Code partner <a href="http://twitter.com/justjamonit">Jam</a>, gave my first lightning talk at a conference. We provided some information about Rails Girls and Rails Girls Summer of Code and also talked about our personal experiences with both. We received lots of positive feedback on our talk. Even better though were the conversations that followed with people from all different places who wanted to know more about what we were doing with Rails Girls in the DC area and what they could do to grow and engage people in their own communities. I haven’t been at this that long but it felt so good to be able to make suggestions and reference what I’ve seen and experienced. Hopefully I’ll get invites to some new Rails Girls workshops in the future.</p>

Once again my voice was shot by the end of the weekend from all the talking I did. It’s a great feeling since I spend most of my 9-5 in silence in my cubicle. I think I only received one business card and I actually kind of liked that. I was able to float in and out of conversations and just chat with people without feeling like I had to prove myself to anyone. I now know about communities that are not too far that I can visit on occasion and also communities that are very far but will have familiar faces if I’m able to venture to them one day. I wish I could list every single person I had the pleasure of talking with and all the organizers who put on such a great conference. Technically I could, but that would take a lot of time and we all know most people leave when movie credits start rolling.</p>

<h3 id="hearts-pittsburgh">♥ Pittsburgh</h3>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%" src="/../assets/2014/08/pittsburgh_pano.jpg" alt="Pittsburgh panorama" />
This weekend was my first time visiting Pittsburgh and I now have a major crush. The city has so much character. I was mainly in the North Shore area where the conference was held at the New Hazlett Theater and also where I stayed in a charming row house (thanks airbnb). Downtown is right across the river, where I had a couple of meals. We also spent the after (first day of the conference) party in the suite level of PNC Park. The ballpark was beautiful although I’m not sure everyone was as excited as I was about the venue. In fact one person told me he’s lived in the Pittsburgh area his whole life and has never attended a Pirates game. Mind blown. After the conference I did some sightseeing on my own. I visited the Andy Warhol Museum which continued to reinforce the idea that I should push myself to do things I love and that challenge me creatively. I checked the <a href="http://www.duquesneincline.org/">Duquesne Incline</a> off my Pittsburgh must-do list and made it to the Strip District to see the different markets and vendors. It makes the markets in DC look like so inadequate. And because I have a love of all things thrift and salvage I found <a href="http://www.constructionjunction.org">Construction Junction</a> and <a href="http://pccr.org/">Pittsburgh Center for Creative Reuse</a> and bought a few odds and ends.

<p>If anybody asks I’ll tell them Steel City Ruby is the best conference I’ve been to. The talks were great, the people were great, the venue was great. Here are my final quick thoughts about the conference: </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The conference pretty much ran on schedule the entire time. If there were delays the schedule had enough breaks throughout that the organizers were able to keep things on track.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Organizing committee. There were so many organizers and it showed, not only because of the yellow shirts they wore throughout the conference, but also in how smoothly everything seemed to run.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Single track ftw. I much prefer the single track conference to multi-track conferences. I didn’t have to contemplate what I wanted to listen to at different times and it was easy to just start talking about a specific session with someone because we all listened to the same talks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open dev space. Since the conference took place at a theater the organizers set up the back stage area as a dev space for people to work on things, chat (quietly), or just take breaks when needed. Another benefit of this space was the instruction to only use the wifi in that area. I think this curbed the use of laptops during talks so the people in the audience were giving speakers more of their attention than I’ve seen in other conferences. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Swag attack. I lost track, but I think I left the conference with about five or six new shirts. I don’t want to name names but I definitely know some people that left with more than 10 shirts. My favorite item that I picked up though was a brochure from the Pittsburgh based company 4 Moms. It was about their dev team and I really liked it because it listed out their stack and also diagrammed their work flow of choice. Other companies could benefit from something informational like that rather than just sending their HR people with stickers and shirts, in my opinion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not conference related, but my some of my new friends from Philadelphia have a podcast called <a href="http://turing.cool/">Turing-Incomplete</a>. It’s a round table format on various programming topics. It’s very conversational and easy to listen to, so check it out.</p>
