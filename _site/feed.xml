        <title>Ruby for Good</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width: 100%&quot; src=&quot;/../assets/2014/08/teampathwayhomes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Team Pathway Homes group photo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past weekend I attended &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyforgood.com&quot;&gt;Ruby for Good&lt;/a&gt; in Fairfax, VA. It also happened to be on the campus of my current employer, George Mason University. The intent of Ruby for Good was to work on projects that benefit others. It was just what I needed. A break from my usual lone wolf-ness and a chance to work in a team environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to call Ruby for Good a conference, because although it was a gathering of a large number of people and there were talks, it wasn’t talking heads the whole weekend. I also wouldn’t call it a hackathon. Yes some teams built applications, but that wasn’t the end-goal. Ruby for Good felt most like a retreat. We stayed in the dorms over the weekend and used different spaces around campus to work on our projects, listen to talks, dine and socialize. It was as much about building as it was about learning and collaborating. The term “growing your network” is pretty cliche at this point, but Ruby for Good attracted people from as far away as Chicago and Atlanta so it really was a great opportunity to get to know people outside of our local community. I also think there’s a bit of self selection that goes into attendance at an event like this, so the atmosphere over the weekend was very friendly and open. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I spend most of my day working in a very quiet office with no other developers this was a great opportunity for me to code on a team. I joined a project for a local non-profit, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pathwayhomes.org/&quot;&gt;Pathway Homes&lt;/a&gt;. Pathway Homes provides affordable housing for the mentally disabled. We built a maintenance request ticket system for them so they could keep better track of repair requests that come in from tenants and property managers. My team was very large, and in most cases that might be cause for concern with so many different viewpoints. But our team chemistry was great. We took time initially to make sure we fully understood the needs of Pathway Homes. We also mapped out the primary work flow and application architecture before dividing the work up amongst the team. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We built the application with a Rails back-end and a Frankenstein style Rails/&lt;a href=&quot;https://angularjs.org/&quot;&gt;AngularJS&lt;/a&gt; front end. Since most of us hadn’t used Angular before we didn’t have enough time to create a pure single page Angular front-end. I worked on the service requests index view and also helped with some of the styling. My contribution was small in the scheme of all the work that went into the application, but the opportunity to learn Angular for the first time with people around to answer questions was good and now I know why people are so enthusiastic about it. I didn’t have time to dive deep into the framework, but my favorite part was how easy it is to set up filtering. That’s something I always need in the Rails applications I start but then I get overwhelmed with all the different filters I need and how to set them up. With AngularJS it was so simple to set up a search box that would search through all the tickets on the index page. Just two bits of code in the index and a little more code in the Angular controller and the whole thing was working. I can’t wait to go over it more and see how I can add it to a couple of old applications I’ve started that are very data focused.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only downside to the entire event was the sadness that came at the end, knowing that I have to go back to working alone. But it was really incredible to see that in less than three full days we developed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pathway-homes.herokuapp.com/&quot;&gt;fully functional application&lt;/a&gt; that Pathway Homes can start using. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to talk about our working process in a little more detail. By the time we demo-ed the application on Sunday afternoon we had over 400 commits and over 40 closed issues. We used Github for the project &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alindeman/pathway-homes&quot;&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt; and made the brave decision to just push changes directly to master, while constantly pulling to try. Since most of us weren’t working on the same files at the same time we didn’t have a high rate of merge conflicts. There may have been an incident or two, like me deleting the application controller. But I put it back! I never program with other developers so it took me a little bit to get down the steps I needed to correctly add my changes without conflicts. We also used &lt;a href=&quot;https://waffle.io/alindeman/pathway-homes&quot;&gt;Waffle.io&lt;/a&gt; which put all of our Github issues into a virtual kanban so we could quickly see what still needed to be worked on and how things were progressing. This was especially useful since we were all working on small parts and allowed us to see how the ship was moving overall and where someone could jump in if they finished something they were working on. We also used &lt;a href=&quot;http://hipchat.com/&quot;&gt;HipChat&lt;/a&gt; to share links and communicate when we weren’t in the same spaces. I didn’t realize HipChat has completely changed their pricing and they now have a completely free offering. So now I’m trying to think of ways I can get it back in my life because I’ve missed it so much. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some stray observations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I learned to cook bacon! Ruby for Good was an all-inclusive event, but in this type of environment catered food just won’t do. We divided meal responsibilities among teams and my team cooked breakfast for everyone on Saturday morning. It’s another great way to bring people together. I also learned that you can make large quantities of scrambled eggs in the oven. Except the oven we were using didn’t work very well so I’ll have to take their word for that one.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing I was pleasantly surprised by was the number of people there who attended or are currently attending code schools. The ones I talked to all spoke very highly of their experiences. And in a small world moment I ran into a friend I participated in Founder’s Institute with. He recently completed Dev Bootcamp and was preparing to start his first full-time programming job in D.C. on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I definitely recommend Ruby for Good to anyone in the future. This was the inaugural event and I certainly hope it continues. There was such a wide variety of projects, from documentation, to writing test suites, to full-blown applications, there was something for any skill level or interest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Huge shout out to everyone on Team Pathway Homes! &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/alindeman&quot;&gt;Andy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/brandonlrice&quot;&gt;Brandon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bglusman&quot;&gt;Brian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ecbailey&quot;&gt;Emily&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/jmaisu&quot;&gt;James&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/mad_typist&quot;&gt;Jessie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mepps&quot;&gt;Maggie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/melaniew&quot;&gt;Mel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/RMalecky&quot;&gt;Ryan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Repeat Yourself</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The best way I’ve found to retain knowledge and truly learn is by repeating myself. I engrain practices in my head through repition and see parts in a new light each time. More often than not I don’t revisit projects or exercises though and want to make a better habit of that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I spent some time with the always helpful, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/josh_cheek&quot;&gt;Josh Cheek&lt;/a&gt;. Josh was in D.C. for a week and spent a couple of days helping me to learn and learn how to learn. You read that right. From time to time I go through materials on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theodinproject.com&quot;&gt;The Odin Project&lt;/a&gt;, which is a great, open-source (i.e. free as in beer), programming curriculum. It’s outlined similarly to many of the coding bootcamps that are growing in popularity and I definitely recommend checking it out. When Josh arrived I was just preparing to start a Ruby &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/advanced-building-blocks&quot;&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; that required me to write my own version of many of the common Enumerable methods. A bit of panic set in but Josh thought this was a great lesson and a great opportunity to try katas. A kata, in &lt;a href=&quot;&#39;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)&#39;&quot;&gt;programming terms&lt;/a&gt;, is improving your skills and knowledge through pracitice and repition. So in this case I would write all of my Enumerable mehods and then write them again and again, hopefully getting faster each time and understanding them better which will also lead to refactoring. Actually writing my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/britneywright/my_enumerable&quot;&gt;initial&lt;/a&gt; Enumerable methods took hours. Thankfully Josh is a very patient teach and by the end I felt like I really gained a much deeper understanding of enumerables. You can see my first completed kata here. Afterwards, I rewrote all of my methods one or two more times before moving on to adding more methods. I got stuck here and there, but fortunately I was able to talk them out with Josh and push on. Unfortunately I let other shiny objects distract me and I haven’t revisited &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/britneywright/my_enumerable_2&quot;&gt;this exercise&lt;/a&gt; in a couple of weeks. But yesterday something prompted me to remember it and the value it provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago I, along with my pair partner, started &lt;a href=&quot;http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/&quot;&gt;Rails Girls Summer of Code&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll be working on two popular open source Ruby on Rails projects, BrowserCMS and Spree. BrowserCMS is a a content management system, for those unfamiliar with the CMS space, think Wordpress or Drupal, which are more commonly known, PHP-based, CMS platforms. Spree is an e-commerce platform. Our goal is to create a module for BrowserCMS that would make it easier to integrate Spree. We believe that this type of module would make it easier for developers to get started with them in a single project and could lead to increased use of both. So far we’ve focused on learning BrowserCMS by trying to build the basic features of an online store through the CMS (minus payment stuff). We had some hiccups at the start. Since BrowserCMS recently released a beta of their newest version a lot of the documentation is outdated so we’ve had to determine what instructions apply to us and what doesn’t as we’re building our sites. Over the past week I’ve been knocking items off our list of features we outlined as common to online bookstores. When we met yesterday though I realized that a lot of the approaches I took were not necessarily using BrowserCMS in the best way or weren’t the most efficient. For a moment I felt defeated, but then I thought back to the katas I did with the Enumerable methods. I realized that rather than just taking notes and moving on, this would be a great opportunity for me to go back through the features I’ve bult so far and do them again based on the discussions we had as a team. So that’s where I’m at now. About to start building version 2.0 of my pratice book store. My goal is to write my code more confidently this time, which to me means better and faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And once I finish rebuilding my project to it’s most current feature-set I think I’ll revisit my enumerable methods and do a few more katas with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you tried katas, The Odin Project or any of the other projects and ideas I mentioned? Let me know. As always you can find me on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/britneywright&quot;&gt;@britneywright&lt;/a&gt; and here on my blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://alwaysbelearning.co&quot;&gt;Always Be Learning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cynthialanel/status/486986287505604608&quot;&gt;@cynthialanel&lt;/a&gt; for this gem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/britneywright/status/484905258909704192&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; last week about the importance of watching videos or reading blog posts in their entirety before going off to work on your own projects. I’m guilty of not doing this often and suffer the consequences. I spend hours looking to solve something, only to realize if I would’ve just watched two more minutes of a video or read a couple more paragraphs and that original resource would’ve solved what I was working on.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Blog Configuration</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal:&lt;/strong&gt; Setup second blog using Github Pages, Jekyll and a custom domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progress:&lt;/strong&gt; Completed, one day&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve set up a number of personal websites and blogs over the years, but it seems that each time I do things a little bit differently. I moved on from wordpress at the beginning of the year for the simpler pastures of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. Using my text editor to write my posts allows me to focus more on writing and less on all the other “stuff” that comes along with platforms like Wordpress. Pushing to Github is quick and easy, and also means everything you write is automatically backed up. And best of all, if you’re using a public repo it’s free. I’m slowly weaning myself off of paid hosting and finding it to be a much smoother experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitHub Project Pages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Migrating my first &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.onebrokeb.com&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; was fairly straightforward since Github allows one User Pages site per account. I felt like it was possible to setup more than one blog, but wasn’t sure of the process. So today I spent a bit of time researching the blog setup and also if there would be any domain issues before I went out and purchased my new domain. From the GitHub documentation I determined that I needed to create my second blog as a Project Pages site. After one false start with setting up the repo properly I found and followed the initial steps outlined by &lt;a href=&quot;http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/&quot;&gt;Anna Debenham&lt;/a&gt;. The unique thing about Project Page sites is that they are intended to contain project files and site files in the same repo, but in separate branches. Since I’m just plannig a standalone site I only needed the gh-pages branch in the repo. So when I got to the “Make gh-pages your default branch” part of Anna’s post I used a command line prompt provided by &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/setting-default-git-branch-in-bare/&quot;&gt;François Marier&lt;/a&gt;. Then I continued through Anna’s post until just after the “jekyll new” part. She continues to go over creating individual files, but once Jekyll is installed it already includes the necessary files to get started and I wanted to finish my initial setup before customizing anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Custom domain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last part of my initial setup was the domain. I use a different domain registrar each time, with mixed results. Today I chose to go with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.namecheap.com&quot;&gt;Namecheap&lt;/a&gt; and I was pleasantly surprised by the simple process and clean interface. They didn’t have ads all over the place, or try to upsell me on a million things. It was straightforward and a good price of only about $15 for the domain and they include Whois privacy at no extra cost. The final step was creating the CNAME file in my repo and changing the A records in Namecheap to point my new domain, alwaysbelearning.co to the blog. After everything was deployed and configured it seemed to only take a few minutes for the site to load on the domain. Victory!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then I’ve updated the __config.yml file with my basic site info. I also wrote an about page and created my first inspirational graphic for the site using the nifty tool &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.canva.com&quot;&gt;Canva&lt;/a&gt;, and wrote my first posts. Hopefully over the next week I’ll find time to work on the site aesthics, but I really plan on doing on going experiments with the look of the site as I experiment with different front-end tools and techniques. But all in all, not bad for a day’s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- B&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hello Universe!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal&lt;/strong&gt;: Create a space to talk about my ongoing learning affair with development and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progress&lt;/strong&gt;: First post&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’re off! Check out my &lt;a href=&quot;http://alwaysbelearning.com/about&quot;&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; page for the full run down of why I created this blog. But the short story is that I finally feel comfortable enough talking tech that I actually want to write about what I’m doing and what I’m learning. Of course there’s the standard “hope someone else out there will benefit” goal, but really at it’s core this space is for me. I’ll be winning, losing, making mistakes, learning from my mistakes. On the good days I’ll reflect on how far I’ve come and on the bad days I’ll reflect on how far I’ve come. Sounds like an all upside proposition to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in case you were wondering where the inspiration for the blog name came from. I have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CodeNewbies&amp;amp;src=typd&quot;&gt;#CodeNewbies&lt;/a&gt; Twitter chat to thank for that. In a moment of genius I tweeted the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/britneywright/statuses/481974760034013184&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/../assets/2014/06/abl-tweet.png&quot; alt=&quot;Focus on the journey, not the destination. Joy is found not in finishing an activity but in doing it.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a name and new blog idea were born. Enjoy the ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- B&lt;/p&gt;
