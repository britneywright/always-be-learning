There comes a time in every person's life where they need to start a niche blog. Okay that's not true, but the time has come for me. I've been doing the "learning to code" thing for over a year now and I finally feel like I'm getting somewhere with it.

One of the first things I realized when I started this journey, and the notion that has stayed with me through success and failure, is that I will always be learning. And more importantly, I want to always be learning. It's what drives me everyday and makes me confident that this ever-evolving area of development and technology is what I want be a part of.

My current goals with this blog are simple. Exciting times are ahead and I want to clearly chart them. I also want to share not only what I create, but the process and roadmap I followed to produce the outcomes.

If you've stumbled across my blog and have no idea who I am you can find my "career stats" at [britneywright.com](http://www.britneywright.com.) I tweet and retweet [@britneywright](http://www.twitter.com/britneywright). I git commit at [github.com/britneywright](http://github.com/britneywright). And if you want a peak at my life beyond the code (buyer beware) my personal blog is at [onebrokeb.com](http://onebrokeb.com).

Cheers!
